# What is the Forest Carbon Succession Extension? 

The Forest Carbon Succession (ForCs) extension for the LANDIS-II model includes growth, mortality and decay. This extension allows you to track the C in 5 pools for each living age-species cohort, plus 9 dead organic matter and soil pools for each species. The extension reports Net Primary Productivity, Heterotrophic Respiration, Net Ecosystem Productivity, Net Biome Productivity and transfers to the forest products sector caused by harvesting. 

The growth and reproduction generally follow the Biomass Succession (v5.2) extension and the methods outlined in Scheller and Mladenoff (2004) and Scheller and Miranda (2020). In addition, changes in dead organic matter (DOM) and soil carbon are tracked over time. The modelling of decay generally follows the methods of the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector v3 described in Kurz et al. (2009).

The carbon pools tracked in ForCs and available as outputs (gC/m2) are: woody biomass, non-woody biomass, fine roots, coarse roots, foliar litter plus dead fine roots, fine and small woody debris plus dead coarse roots in the forest floor, coarse woody debris, F, H and O horizons, dead fine roots in the mineral soil, dead coarse roots in the mineral soil, humified organic matter in the mineral soil, snag stem wood, and snag other wood.
# Features

- [x] Users can choose the stand-level model they want to use.
- [x] New! Version 3.1 is compatible with Biomass Harvest!
- [x] New! Version 3.1 allows you to tailor carbon transfers to each harvest prescription!
